Sirius is a serverless application built using Atlassian Forge, integrating TestRail with Jira to calculate and update test metrics Coverage (%) and Pass Rate (%) based on Milestones that reference the jira work items. It operates as a middleware that handles scheduled api requests, processing events from TestRail, making API calls to fetch test data, performing calculations and updating Jira issues. The app uses JavaScript (Node.js runtime) with the @forge/api library for HTTP requests and Jira interactions.
